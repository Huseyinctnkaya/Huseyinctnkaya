### Shopify Developer | Software Developer

I’m an 18-year-old front-end developer based in Turkey. My journey in software development began around six years ago, driven by a deep curiosity and passion for coding. Since then, I’ve continuously worked on improving my skills and expanding my knowledge.  

For the past two years, I’ve been specializing in Shopify front-end development, combining my technical skills with a strong interest in e-commerce. I enjoy building clean, user-friendly interfaces and helping brands create seamless online shopping experiences.  

I’m constantly learning, growing, and pushing myself to stay up-to-date with the latest trends in web development and e-commerce. My goal is to build a strong career at the intersection of technology and digital commerce.
